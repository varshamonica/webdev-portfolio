    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <h4>Movies/Series</h4>
    <p>Binge watching movies and shows is one of my favourite weekend activites.</p>
    <h4>Videography/Editing</h4>
    <p>
        Even though I am not very good at videography, it is something that I really enjoy.
        I find it soothing to capture everyday nuances. 
        Editing all these videos into short stories helps me focus my mind
